# Japanese-Shakkanh-Unit-Conversion-Calculator-Equations
A project for creating a conversion calculator for traditional Japanese units.

This project was created to share the source code of a conversion calculator that I created on the online system known as vCalc. 

The calculator can be viewed here: https://www.vcalc.com/wiki/jmorris/Japanese+%28Shakkanh%C5%8D%29+Unit+Conversion+Calculator

The calculator was written using Apache Groovy, however, since vCalc fills in the context and other aspects of the code only the basic algorithms needed for the calculator are included here. Feel free to reuse them in your own projects.

In the future, there is a chance that I will develop the code further in order to create a downloadable conversion calculator seperate from the vCalc system.
