# Japanese-Shakkanhō-Unit-Conversion-Calculator-Equations
A project for creating a conversion calculator to convert traditional Japanese units to metric and imperial units of measurement.

This project was created to share the source code of a conversion calculator that I created on the online system, vCalc. 

The calculator can be viewed here: https://www.vcalc.com/wiki/jmorris/Japanese+%28Shakkanh%C5%8D%29+Unit+Conversion+Calculator

The calculator was written using Apache Groovy, however, since vCalc fills in the context and other aspects of the code only the basic algorithms needed for the equations used in calculator are included here. These equations principally define the value of Shakkanhō units based on their metric conversion, but also include a "switch" function. Each file is grouped according to the type of units used (area, length, weight etc.) Feel free to reuse the equations in your own projects.

In the future, I plan develop the code further in order to create a downloadable conversion calculator seperate from the vCalc system.
